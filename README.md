## Website Description

The Golf Club App is a community-driven platform designed for golf enthusiasts to log, track, and share their golfing experiences. Members can document the courses they've played, record scores, track the number of holes completed, and even add personal notes—whether it’s about an incredible shot, course conditions, or a frustrating sand trap!
Beyond personal tracking, the app fosters community engagement by allowing members to explore other players' game logs, discover new courses, and gain insights from fellow golfers' experiences.

## Background Information

The idea behind the Golf Club App stems from the need for a digital clubhouse where golfers can stay connected beyond the course. Whether you're looking to track your progress, share experiences, or discover new courses, this platform provides a space for golfers of all skill levels to interact and engage.
By creating a centralized hub for golf enthusiasts, the app helps bridge the gap between personal game tracking and a shared community experience—enhancing the social aspect of the sport.
